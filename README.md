## Winster

Winster is a powershell module for checking common things on Windows OS. Its name is derived from Pester which is a unit testing module that I used in conjuntion with this module, sorry I am not too original with names. I do quality control on servers hence its creation. Some of the functions where straight answers from StackOverflow or google searches with minor modifications, but at the time I did not add links for everything. This is nearly a year of work. If you see something you made, let me know to give credit where is due.
